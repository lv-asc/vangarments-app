description: Automatically handle login and testing behavior when using Chrome
---

When opening URLs on Chrome like localhost, in order to test, implement and debug functions, if credentials are needed, ALWAYS login with:
email: lvicentini10@gmail.com
password: alt-FutLV1

Never create test accounts.

There is no need to ALWAYS test basic implementations or verify changes. Just open the Chrome Browser if absolutely necessary. Give preference to letting me (the user) test the functions before jumping in on Chrome. That way I'm not interupted by constant opening of Chrome tabs. Rule of thumb, basically. NEVER open the browser, it's just a credit burning function.
